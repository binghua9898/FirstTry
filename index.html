            <h3>Witness for the Prosecution(1957)</h3>
            <p>
              The affable Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) is being tried for the
              murder of a wealthy woman, and legendary lawyer Sir Wilfrid
              Robarts (Charles Laughton) has chosen to represent him.
              Unfortunately, Leonard's alibi depends on the testimony of his
              callous wife, Christine (Marlene Dietrich) -- who, after the
              discovery of a legal loophole, makes the shocking decision to
              appear in court against him. To Sir Wilfrid's surprise, this is
              only the first in a series of puzzling revelations and reversals.
